### Day 3 (oct. 20): tried learing a little more javascript on freecodecamp.org but couldnt get into the zone (4 hrs of sleep) so instead I decided tp read some coding books from [This repository](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)

### Day 4 (oct 21.): I have to stop the challenge here for now, I've been busy with school work however I will restart the 100 day coding challenge soon -joejoe
